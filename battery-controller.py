"""
Controlls the charging power of a fronius battery to achieve peak shaving.
My fronius symo hybrid 3-0.3 is capapble of 5kW input, but only
of 3kW AC output. My 4kWp Generator is sometimes able to generate more than
3kW and the fronius is in this case able to charge the battery with the power
above 3kW AC.
The fronius is not able to control how fast the battery is charged, but only
allows to set a time when charging should be started. But then the battery is
charged with full power.
My small battery however is then full in about 1.5h. So by limitting the
charging power I can achieve peak shaving for a longer time.
The control strategy below sets the charging power to the power exceeding 3kW.
With respect to a future goecharger-controller, this controller here only
handles the power above 3kW AC. The goecharger-controller handles everything
up to 3kW AC. So they both do not interfere.
